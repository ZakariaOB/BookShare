Working skeleton API
----------------------------------------

- Useful commands to work for .NET projects
  => dotnet --version : All the installed versions on the machine
  => dotnet -h : help commands
  => dotnet new sln : solution file

- dotnet new webapi -o API : -o output directory as we need the api to have it's own folder
- Add the api to our solution : dotnet sln add API
- In VS code : to hide some folders or files from the solution you can use Files:exclude
  add pattern example : **/bin ; **/obj
- Command to run the .Net core project : dotent run
- Security : Some websites are using https in order to secure the data exchanged using SSL and more adapted version
  TLS => https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/what-is-ssl-tls-https
- Https : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8375134/difference-between-http-and-https#:~:text=HTTPS%20means%20that%20you%20tunnel,How%20to%20use%20HTTPS%3F
- In order for my machine to trust the .NET certificate
  dotnet dev-certs https --trust
- Review : Lecture 8
- dotnet run => Run the application
- The entry point for our application is Program.cs
- Logging level : What happend when we hit endpoints is described by the console logging system
- Use Https redirection (UseHttpsRedirection) : If we come with an http url we are redirected to an https one 
- "launchBrowser": false in launchSettings.json
- dotnet watch run => Keep an eye on the changes
- Benefits of EF :
    => Querying
    => Change tracking
    => Saving
    => Concurrency
    => Transactions
    => Caching
    => Built-in-conventions (Id, foreign key names etc ...)
    => Migrations
- Install Nuget gallery for nuget management
- In order to use the DbContext inside the app make sure to inject it also inside StartUp.cs class
- We can use on appSettings.Developpemnt.json any information that could be seen bu other users
- In order to start code first with EF we need to install dotnet-ef . But it's already installed with EFSql server
  - Migration command : dotnet ef migrations add initialCreate -o Data/Migrations
  > -o : create a folder
- Dotnet tool EF update 
    (update : Update | install : Install)
  => dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef --version 5.0.0-preview.8.20407.4
- The migration files are used to run against a database , when you create a migration it's not updating the model.
- To undo the migration action, use 'ef migrations remove'
- dotnet ef database update
- Always use asynchronous code when dealing with database calls
- Init a git repo : git init
- Add git ignore file : dotnet new gitignore
- appsettings.json should be ignored : To recheck later
- To link the local repo to a distant one : git remote add origin https://github.com/ZakariaOB/BookShare.git


Working skeleton ANGULAR
----------------------------------------
- update 
    NodeJs : Reinstall it
    npm : 
       Run PowerShell as Administrator
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
        npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade
        npm-windows-upgrade   
- Use the angular CLI
- npm install -g @angular/cli
- Decoratcor : Giving a class some extra power
- Lecture : 23 => Making http requests in Angular

- CORS : Modern browsers will not allow reaching an app from a different origin than 
  the one containing it (The difference could be simply on the port number, as example API and client
  projects that we are using) . To allow this AddCors() inside the API.
- Normally don't use jQuery as Angular also change the DOM
- Install angular bootstrap (ngx-bootstrap)
- ng add ngx-bootstrap
- Install a certificate for our angular app to use https (SSL)
- We don't want to put any sensible information inside our client project


Authentication basics
-----------------------------------------------
- dotnet ef migrations add UpdateAppUser -o Data/Migrations
- Think about validating your dtos coming from the client side even if the client will validate 
  things before hitting the API
- [APIController] is the responsible of using DTOs validation rules and send back issues 
  for the requests coming from the API .
- We can validate our models : [Required] , [Email], [StringLength] and others and we can also 
  our custom validators
- Did the register endpoint and then the login one inside the AccountController
- Services are good to manage on 'AddScoped' as we don't need the service as soon as a request 
  is done .
- For new packages => Open nuGet gallery
- In order for .NET core to handle the authentication we need Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
  installed .
- The logic behind is that : We use the authentication middlware of .NET core and we configure it on the StartUp class 
  > services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme) (Extension class)
  > app.UseAuthentication => to enbale the usage of the service 
  > app.UseAuthorization => To enable the usage of the UseAuthorization
  > At this point when you login you get your token generated inside the app and propably recognized by the authentication middlware
  > Now the app knwos your token
  > [Authorize] will check your token and will give you access or not to the requested action
